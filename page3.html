					<p>
						Patras and its region is home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments, 
						including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio and the Fortress (castle) of Patras. 
						More specifically, the main sights of the city are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Roman Odeon, the most significant ancient monument, is in the upper town and was built around 160 AD, in the reign of either Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius. 
							It has been restored and partially reconstructed, and is used as an open-air theatre for performances and concerts in the summer.
						</li>
						<li>
							The medieval Patras Castle, in the ancient acropolis overlooking the city, was initially built in the 6th century AD by the Byzantine emperor Justinian, 
							having many additions from the period of the Frankish and Venetian rule of the city, up to as far as the time of the Despotate of Morea and later the Ottoman Empire. 
							Its current outline dates back to the second Venetian rule of the town (1687â€“1715). Today, its interior is used as a public garden.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Roman Amphitheatre, near the Roman Odeon, in Ifestou street, dating from the 1st century AD, at a period of the biggest development of Roman Patras. 
							Its area has been only partially excavated.
						</li>
						<li>
							The church of Saint Andrew of Patras was founded in 1908 by King George I and was inaugurated in 1974. 
							It is dedicated to Saint Andrew, the patron of the city and is near the seafront, between the areas of the new and the old port.
							It is the second largest temple of byzantine style in the Balkans (after the Cathedral of Saint Sava in Belgrade). 
							The central cupola is 46 m (151 ft) tall and is the base for a 5 m (16 ft) gold-plated cross and twelve smaller ones, symbolizing Christ and the twelve apostles. 
							A congregation of at least 5,000 can attend a sermon within the church.
						</li>
						<li>
							The municipal Theatre Apollon, built in 1872 to plans by the German architect Ernst Ziller. 
							The building is characteristic of the 19th century neoclassical style and is in the central square of the city.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Achaia Clauss wine industry and tasting center, which is on the outskirts in Petroto village. 
							It was founded in 1861 by the Bavarian Gustav Clauss and is most famous for its Mavrodaphne.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Patras Archaeological Museum exhibits the history of Patras from the prehistoric era to the late Roman period. 
							The exhibition is divided into three thematic sections demonstrated in the three large separate halls of the museum: 
							the Chamber of Private Life, the Hall of Necropolis and the Hall of Public Life.
						</li>
						<li>
							The remains of the Roman aqueduct, that led from the springs of Romanos to the acropolis. The aqueduct measured 6.5 km (4.04 mi) from the water cistern to the castle. 
							For the greater part of this distance, the water passed through a man-built underground pipe, over passing valleys and gorges on carefully constructed archways, parts of which still stand, in the area of Aroi.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Roman bridge over the river Milichos, which dates from 114 AD. 
							It is in Agyia, in the northern suburbs of the city, at the junction of Aretha street and the National Road.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Turkish baths building (16th century), in Boukaouri street, 
							still retain their initial use, and are one of the few Turkish baths surviving in Europe.
						</li>
						<li>
							The reconstructed "Faros" (Lighthouse), which is the symbol of the city. 
							The lighthouse is situated at the seaside front between the old and the new port, 
							at the end of Trion Navarhon street.
						</li>
