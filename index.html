						Patras (Modern Greek: Πάτρα, Greek pronunciation: [ˈpatra]) is Greece's third largest urban area 
						and the regional capital of Western Greece, in northern Peloponnese, 
						215 km (134 mi) west of Athens. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The city is built at the foothills of Mount Panachaikon, overlooking the Gulf of Patras.


						The city is divided into the upper and the lower section, connected with roads and broad stairs. 
						The upper section (Ano Poli) is the older and the more picturesque; however, the lower section (Kato Poli) is laid out according to the 1858 city plan, featuring a variety of squares. 
						The most notable of these are the Psila Alonia and the Georgiou I Square.
						A number of notable neoclassical buildings are to be found, including the Apollon Theatre in Georgiou I Square, 
						the Town Hall, the headquarters of the Local Trade Association and the Court of Justice. 
						A replica of the city's emblematic old lighthouse - which was at the dock of Ayios Nikolaos - rises at the end of Trion Navarhon street, near the temple of Saint Andreas.
