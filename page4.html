						The cultural activity of Patras includes the Patras International Festival (with various artistic activities, 
						mainly in the fields of theatre and music), the Patras Carnival and the Poetry Symposium.
						The city hosts many museums, including the Patras Archaeological Museum, the History and Ethnology Museum, the Folk Art Museum, the Press Museum and the Technology Museum, 
						the latter in the campus of Patras University.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other cultural institutes are: the Visual Arts Workshop, the icon painting school, the Carnival Float Workshop, the Municipal Library, the Municipal Gallery, 
						along with many private art galleries. The architectural heritage of the city is dominated by neo-classicism, but also includes structures from other periods. 
						Patras is also a pilot city of the Council of Europe and EU Intercultural cities programme.

					<h1>Theatrical tradition and music</h1>
					<p>
						The Patras Municipal and Regional Theatre was founded in June 1988. The theatre's founding artistic directors were the actors Maya Liberopoulou and Viktor Arditis, 
						and the institution draws its funding from the Municipality of Patras and the Ministry of Culture, having as its main stage the city's landmark, the Apollon Theatre. 
						Throughout its existence it has mounted critically acclaimed performances ranging from ancient dramaturgy and modern Greek, to international repertoire. 
						The theatre cooperates with other theatrical groups, such as the Viomichaniki (Industrial) group and the Michani Technis' (Art Machine). 
						The Roman Odeon hosts ancient dramas in the summer, while the Pantheon theater, the Art Factory, the Lithographeion and the Agora theatres provide additional venues. 
						The International Festival of Patras takes place every summer, with a program consisting mostly of plays—both ancient drama and modern theatre—as well as various musical events.
					</p>
					<p>
						Patras has also a very strong indie rock scene with critically acclaimed bands such as Raining Pleasure, Abbie Gale, Serpentine, Doch an Doris and others. 
						The city is also the birthplace of Karagiozis (shadow theatre) in Greece, with Dimitris Sardounis as founder.
						In addition, there are several conservatoires and music schools, including one devoted exclusively to Byzantine music, several orchestras and choirs. 
						There are also a number of dance schools, and there are plans to set up a dance theatre within the context of the Patras Municipal and Regional Theatre. 
						The latter hosts a full-time professional theatre group, while there are several amateur groups performing in the city.
